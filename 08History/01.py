# Perceptron: Frank Rosenblatt(~1957) - AND/OR, impossible to solve XOR
# MLP: Marvin Minsky(1969) - no method to train NLP >>> dark age
# Backpropagation: Paul Werbos(1974, 1982), Jeoffrey Hinton(1986) >>> 1st breakthrough
# hard to train deep MLPs: Yann LeCun(1995) - SVM, Random Forest better than MLP >>> dark age
# * LeNet-5(CNN): Yann LeCun(1980)
# DBN by a good initialization method(layerwise training etc): Jeoffrey Hinton(2006) >>> 2nd breakthrough
#  * Deep Networks by a good initialization method: Yoshua Bengio(2007)
#  * Rebranding of NNs to Deep Neural Networks & Deep Learning
# Alex Net(2012)
